## 📖 Description

InsiKt is a fork of Logger++ focused on the core features that I personally find useful during my tests. 



In addition to logging requests and responses from all
Burp Suite tools, the extension allows advanced filters to be defined to highlight interesting entries or filter logs to
only those which match the filter.

A built in grep tool allows the logs to be searched to locate entries which match a specified pattern, and extract the
values of the capture groups.

To enable logs to be used in other systems, the table can also be uploaded to elasticsearch.

## ✨ Features

- **Comprehensive Logging** - Logs all tools sending requests and receiving responses
- **Selective Logging** - Ability to log from specific tools
- **Custom Regex Support** - Show results of custom regular expressions in request/response
- **Customizable Headers** - Personalize column headers to your preferences
- **Advanced Filtering** - Create filters to display only requests matching specific strings or regex patterns
- **Row Highlighting** - Make interesting requests pop with filter-based highlighting
- **Built-in Grep** - Search through logs efficiently
- **Live Monitoring** - Real-time requests and responses
- **Multiple Views** - Various display options to suit your workflow
- **Pop-out Panels** - Detach view panels for better multitasking
- **Multithreaded** - High-performance concurrent processing
